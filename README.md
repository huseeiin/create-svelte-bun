# ðŸš€ Create a new [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app using Bun with less boilerplate.

**Features:**

-   Much more organized file structure than `create-svelte`.
-   Leverage the fast [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime in both prod and dev environments.
-   Uses latest package versions unlike `create-svelte`.
-   Uses `modules` vite build target instead of the default SvelteKit `esnext` which _may_ mean more browser support.
-   Adds sensible default VSCode settings and extensions to project root so your team's DX is as amazing as yours.
